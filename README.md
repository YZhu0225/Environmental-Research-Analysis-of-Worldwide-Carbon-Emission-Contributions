# Environmental-Research-Analysis-of-Worldwide-Carbon-Emission-Contributions

This repository contains a comprehensive study focused on understanding and modeling economic factors into a nation’s carbon emissions. The study aims to understand how different economic status groups affect a nation’s carbon footprint and categorizes nations into high, medium, or low carbon emitters.

## Overview
- Objective: Analyze the relationship between economic factors and carbon emissions across nations.
- Data Source: World Inequality Database
- Key Findings:
  - Carbon emissions vary across income brackets.
  - Developed a model that predicts and categorizes a country's emission level with 95% accuracy.

## Contents
1. Data Exploration:

  - Analysis of carbon emissions over time for ten countries.
  - Relationship between GDP and CO2 emissions.
  - Impact of income brackets on carbon emissions.

2. Data Modeling:

  - Linear Mixed Model for income brackets.
  - Cumulative Link Mixed Model for predicting carbon emission levels.

3. Results:

  - Detailed results from the models.
  - Graphs and visualizations.

4. Conclusion & Future Work:

  - Summary of findings.
  - Recommendations for future research.
